# The foundation is pinned like everything else

## Rests on

Every chart and image in the pack-delivered foundation publishes immutable,
enumerable versions, so an exact version can be written down without freezing
the foundation: the bump arrives as a Renovate PR instead of an hourly
reconcile. False if: a foundation chart publishes only a moving reference, or
sits in a repository Renovate's Flux manager cannot enumerate. Settled by: for
each of the fifteen wildcard constants in `src/adapters/flux-utils.ts`, run
`helm search repo <chart> --versions` against the repository URL declared beside
it (each must list at least two immutable semver versions), then dry-run
Renovate over a tree rendered with those versions pinned: one bump per chart.
The premise here is [0002](../model/0002-kubernetes-as-substrate.md), which is what makes
a Flux `HelmRelease` the delivery mechanism for the foundation at all; this
record does not stand on push delivery
([0008](0008-tested-equals-deployed-requires-push.md)), and is a live defect
whichever way that premise falls.

## Why

`src/adapters/flux-utils.ts` sets `"*"` as the chart version default fifteen
times: cert-manager (`:615`), external-dns (`:624`), traefik-public (`:640`),
traefik-lan (`:662`), MetalLB (`:677`), VSO (`:689`), RabbitMQ (`:769`) and the
observability stack (eight more, `:825`-`:889`). A Flux `HelmRelease` with
`version: "*"` resolves to the newest published chart on every reconcile, and the
intervals beside those constants are `1h`. That is the set
`spec/v1/50-lifecycle.md:38-47` calls *"the foundation everything else stands
on"*, the Secret Store, the operator delivering every secret, both Traefiks
(*"every route"*), cert-manager, external-dns, MetalLB, and the half the
aggregator gate deliberately excludes, so nothing tests it. Class A gets a lock,
a digest, a gate and a vcluster; class B gets a wildcard on an hourly timer,
while the chapter calls the boundary *"enforced, not documented"*.

The cost is not hypothetical. `traefik-public/release.yaml` renders
`replicas: 1` with `maxSurge: 0` and `hostPort: 80/443` (a structural outage
window on every chart bump, on the single component fronting all public TLS)
while [0030](../model/0030-runtime-mechanics-derived.md) carries the pattern for
everything behind it: all four first-party deployments run `maxSurge: 1,
maxUnavailable: 0`, their comments recording what it cost, *"under `Recreate`
every image roll opened a zero-pod window, so a slow cold start or a flaky ghcr
image pull took the MCP fully down (503)"*. Under `"*"` that window opens
unattended, at an hour's notice, with no record of what version opened it.

The gap runs past charts. `platform-postgres.service.yml:34-35` pins the database
eight Services depend on to `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, a mutable tag commented as
bypassing the lock, while `30-deliverables.md:224` makes a floating tag
`E_FLOATING_IMAGE`. Both production-touching workflows invoke bare `npx
deploy-config-schema`, registry-resolved at invocation, while the one workflow
that never touches production installs an exact version
(`service-publish-fragment.yml:50-57`); the in-cluster runner holding the deploy
ServiceAccount runs `actions/checkout@v4` and `oras-project/setup-oras@v1`,
floating; and this repository's CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:51`) pipes a
third-party script from `main` into `bash`. So class B takes class A's
discipline: exact chart versions, images by digest, Renovate bumps behind the
gate of [0040](../model/0040-renovate-ordering-gate.md), exact toolkit versions in
workflows, actions pinned by SHA. Pinning schedules the traefik window rather
than closing it; a VIP via MetalLB (dropping `hostPort` for `maxSurge: 1`) or an
accepted window is settled in the chapter, on `helm template` output. The
wildcards are a live defect today, fixable ahead of this record ever merging.

## Alternatives

| option | cost if taken | why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Keep `"*"` | Free, and upstream fixes land within the hour with no PR. Pays with an untested change arriving hourly on the components carrying all TLS, DNS, routing and secret delivery, a `replicas: 1, maxSurge: 0` restart on each, and no record of what ran when something broke | The estate cannot state what its foundation is running; that is not a safety boundary |
| Redescribe the boundary rather than fix it, the review's own second option: stop calling class A/class B a safety property | An hour of editing, no engineering | The description was the accurate half. Deleting it removes the only sentence making the boundary reviewable, and the foundation stays unpinned |
| Pin charts only, leave workflows and actions floating | Half a day, and closes the hourly-bump exposure | The highest-privilege path stays least pinned: the runner holding the deploy ServiceAccount still runs whatever `@v4` resolves to, and both production workflows still resolve the toolkit at invocation |
| Pin, then auto-merge class B bumps | Near-zero to configure; upgrade latency stays low | The gate excludes class B, so nothing tests a bump between the PR and public TLS ([0049](0049-aggregator-owned-tests.md)). Auto-merge is the current failure with a PR attached |

## Reversibility

Undo cost today: one file. All fifteen constants sit in one block in
`src/adapters/flux-utils.ts`; reverting them to `"*"` and dropping the Renovate
manager stanza is under an hour, and nothing moves until Flux next reconciles.
Becomes irreversible once: the pinned foundation trails upstream by several
minors, un-pinning then jumps many versions in one reconcile across
cert-manager, both Traefiks, MetalLB and VSO, so the way back is staged upgrades.

## Consequences

- Fifteen chart versions become a list somebody maintains: every upstream release opens a PR a human reads, atop a cadence already running 26 releases in ten weeks, paid by joris and by reviewers, who must not learn to rubber-stamp them.
- Upgrades stop arriving free: a published CVE fix waits for a merge instead of landing within the hour, paid by whoever owns foundation patch latency, which becomes a number rather than a shrug.
- Both production workflows must install an exact toolkit version from one readable place, and the runner repository needs its own Renovate configuration or its SHA pins rot, paid by whoever maintains those workflows.
- Class B becomes reviewable but stays untested: a pinned bump still reaches public TLS with no relationship test in front of it, paid by whoever reads the drift report ([0058](0058-delivery-machinery-observability.md)), and by [0051](0051-vcluster-substrate.md) if the foundation is ever brought inside the gate.
- The chart pin ships ahead of every v1 decision, so the largest exposure closes first and cheapest, paid back to the estate, at the cost of admitting the boundary shipped as a claim rather than a property.
